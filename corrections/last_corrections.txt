DearJonathan,
 
Thanks for your corrections.
I have reread through your thesis and find most corrections to be done and
acceptable.
I especially like your explainations on improvements and the new appendix.
The pulese in Fig. 3.8 also looks nice.
 
There area few places where I think corrections are missing.
Most importantly an explanation how cosmic ray background is killed by the energy threshold
(Askaryan radiation is not unique to neutrinos, hence we need to discriminate!)
 I also can't find a description of antennas and limitations (you mentioned
size is determined by the 30 cm borehole etc...), as well as a description of how
the CR composition is determined.
 




DONE—-Antenna limitations - pages 59-60
DONE—CR composition determination from shower properties — page 38
DONE--cosmic ray background




Minor textual observations:
 
DONE-p42 phot-pion -> photo-pion
DONE-Fig. 3.6 seems to have nu and nubar components, that needs to be explained, as the other figures do separate them
DONE-Fig 3.6 (red, dotted) -> (red, dash-dotted) 
DONE-p63,64 acheived -> achieved
DONE-p71 LABRADOR not defined yet ... 
DONE-p90 affect -> effect (back to your old tricks!)
DONE-p140 indipendent -> independent
DONE-p140 functionality than the testBed -> functionality over the testBed
 
If you can gett hese done over the weekend, I'll sign off on Monday.
best
 Andreas
