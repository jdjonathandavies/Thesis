What is contained in cosmic rays?
Why are zero mass neutrinos a problem, e.g. why does SM describe them to be massless?

-p24 which property of QCD leads to confinement?

-p26 What about SuperK's announcement on 14th May 1998?

-p31 any other hierarchy problems?

-p33 Hess used an electroscope, not a spectrograph!

-p33 "All but the most energetic charged particles will be bent by magnetic fields" -> All charged particles are bent" !!!

Askaryan radiation is not unique to neutrinos, how do we distinguish CR backgrounds?
 
-p48 "Bremmstrahlung" -> Bremsstrahlung

-p58 "use for South Pole" -> used for South Pole

-p61: Trigger section si a bit vague, what makes RF patterns interesting?

-p62 explain formula 4.1
-p62 how is the desired rate determined?
-p65 why cant SBC be cold tested in a climate chamber?

-p67 2x "asses" ->assess

-p67 how do we knwo about firn ice thickness and raybending?

-p73 there is a  betetr figure to explain the two wrap arounds \epsilon_{0,1}

-p74 footnote on Nyquest frequency should be on page 64, where it is first introduced

-p75 explain better how inter-sampel time determined, not fully clear

-p76 "in Section 5.1.1"  -> in the next paragraph

-p79 For the interleaving, what about settle time? How large is it?

-p81 how do we get the offsets in Fig. 5.6?

-p82,83 "affect" -> effect

-p83 Fig. 5.8 comparing a) and c), is there no offset correction applied?

-p85, Fig. 5.10 whats the input frequency?

-p87, Fig. 5.11 explain features i May/September

-p91 "into to two samples" -> into two samples 

-p92 now the trigger requirement is 3 out of 16, before it was 3 out of 8?
-p92 define GPS PPS

-p93 what about Bkg Simulation of cosmic rays?

-p95 CSW should be fully defined (e.g. equation 6.8)

-p98 Fig. 6.2 legends?

-p100,101 The origin of the bias in 6.3 c) is raybending?
pulsers are too close for it to be an effect?
 Why is there no bias in Fig. 6.4 b)?

-p109, 114, 115
define all cut variables (totalBins, CSWPeakVoltage, sumCorrVals, powherence, CW minProb, etc). If possible in a summary table?
-p109 motivation for the cut of totalBins at 20?

-p113 "Along with being reconstructable neutrino events" -> Along with being reconstructable, neutrino events

-p114 which two types of events?
