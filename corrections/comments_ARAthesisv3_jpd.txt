4.
- add an example of a simulated Neutrino signal pulse to Fig. 6.10 on page 108
5.
- add a table of cut variables, with definitions and cut value
6.

7.
- add a short paragraph to the conclusion, describing possible imporvements to ARA stipulated by this thesis
16. 
-p23 define/describe weak charge
31.
Askaryan radiation is not unique to neutrinos, how do we distinguish CR backgrounds?
35.  
-p62 explain formula 4.1
36.  
-p62 how is the desired rate determined?
37.  
-p65 why cant SBC be cold tested in a climate chamber?
39.  
-p67 how do we knwo about firn ice thickness and raybending?
41.  
-p73 there is a  betetr figure to explain the two wrap arounds \epsilon_{0,1}

43.  
-p75 explain better how inter-sampel time determined, not fully clear
45.
-p79 For the interleaving, what about settle time? How large is it?
46.
-p81 how do we get the offsets in Fig. 5.6?
48.
-p83 Fig. 5.8 comparing a) and c), is there no offset correction applied?
49.
-p85, Fig. 5.10 whats the input frequency?
50.
-p87, Fig. 5.11 explain features i May/September

54.
-p93 what about Bkg Simulation of cosmic rays?
55.
-p95 CSW should be fully defined (e.g. equation 6.8)
56.
-p98 Fig. 6.2 legends?
57.
-p100,101 The origin of the bias in 6.3 c) is raybending?
pulsers are too close for it to be an effect?
 Why is there no bias in Fig. 6.4 b)?
58.
-p109, 114, 115
define all cut variables (totalBins, CSWPeakVoltage, sumCorrVals, powherence, CW minProb, etc). If possible in a summary table?
-p109 motivation for the cut of totalBins at 20?
60.
-p114 which two types of events?
61.
-p115 Fig 6.14 How exactly was 380 choosen? What optimization was used? Reference Fig. 6.19
62.
-p116 Fig 6.15 a) The legend is not readable
63.
-p120 Have there been cross checks with data? E.g. simulated calibration events? Checks on the rejection pattern between data and Sim?
 64.
-p124 Fig 6.20, reference 6.15 a) here for more clarity
65.
-p126 Fig 7.1 any explanation for the GOES faetures? Correleation with VPol seems not clear ...
66.
-p127 how long is the deadtime?
67.
-p128 Equation 7.1, How does this depend on the choice of cylinder?  Cite orignal work
68.
-p129 Fig. 7.3 a,b explain features
69.
-p130 Equation 7.3: there seems d\Omega dt dA missing ..., cite source!
70.
-p131 Fig. 7.4 why does the expected curve not cover E> 10^{20} which are interesting?
Does it beat ANITA?
73.
-p133 What is the UHE neutrino flux limit? State it!
