First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor, Ryan Nichol, for this thesis would not have been possible without his knowledge, help and encouragement. I would also like to thank Mark Lancaster who, along with Ryan, gave me the opportunity to study at UCL.

The ARA collaboration provided me with many great collaborators that offered much encouragement and valuable help over the last 3 years, who were also great fun to work with. Special thanks to those I shared my polar exploits with, in particular Hagar Landsman for not only ensuring my return to the North with all my fingers, but also indulged my desire to drive every vehicle under the polar sun. 

Thanks to the UCL HEP group, members former and present,  many evenings have been lost putting the world to rights at the JB.

Away from Physics I would like to thank my family: my brother Mark, my mother Jane and father Steve for supporting me through the last few years. 

Anna has been a constant source of inspiration, picking me up after a hard day and giving so much joy in my life. Here's to the Doctors of Hove.

Finally to my many dear friends, I look forwarding to seeing you all again now that this journey is complete.
