First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor, Ryan Nichol, for this thesis would not have been possible without his knowledge, help and encouragement. I would also like to thank Mark Lancaster who, with Ryan, convinced me to come to UCL.

The ARA collaboration provided me with many great collaborators that offered much encouragement and valuable help over the last 3 years. Special thanks to those I shared my polar exploits with.

Thanks to the UCL HEP group and many lost evenings putting the world to rights at the JB.

Away from Physics I would like to thank my family: my brother Mark, my mother Jane and father Steve for supporting me through the last few years.
